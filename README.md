Summary: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with widespread social disruptions, as governments implemented lockdowns to quell disease spread. To advance knowledge of consequences for households in resource-limited countries, we examined food insecurity during the pandemic period by conducting a cross-sectional study and using logistic regression to examine factors associated with food insecurity.
